# M.E.N.A.C.E

This is an Python implementation of the M.E.N.A.C.E algorithm, designed by Donald Mitchie in 1961.

It also includes a simple Flask app which can be used to play Tic Tac Toe against a number of pre-trained M.E.N.A.C.E agents, a random agent, and a MinMax agent (which plays perfectly).

Original inspiration for this project came from this video from Matt Parker https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9c-_neaxeU

I used a few other resources I referenced for my implementation:
